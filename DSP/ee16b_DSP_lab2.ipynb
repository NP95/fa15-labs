    "Last week we built both a DAC and an ADC to interface real world signals with your computer. Now that we have some information in a format we can work with, we can build a digital system that processes our information. This week we will start by building a clock, which gives our digital circuit some notion of time. Without a clock, we can only work with combinational logic; with a clock we can build circuits like registers which enables sequential logic. After we have a clock, we can build a digital signal processing (DSP) module - which is implemented in the MSP430 Launchpad for our purposes - and see how changing certain parameters of the circuit affect other aspects of the circuit."
