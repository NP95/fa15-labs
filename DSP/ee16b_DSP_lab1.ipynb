    "Welcome to the second module - Digital Signal Procesing! We will begin this module by exploring the circuit interface between discrete and continuous systems. While the \"natural\" world we interact with is analog (your height is not quantized!), our computers work in the digital domain (laptops process values in bits, not in continuous voltage levels). If we want to interface our computer with the \"natural\" world we need to have a mechanism to get a digital signal from an analog signal and an analog signal from a digital signal.\n",

The \"SAR logic\" block then changes the value stored in the \"N-bit Register\", which is the input to the DAC. This modifies the input to the comparator.\n",

Assuming $V_{ref}$ is the highest input voltage possible, to approximate the input voltage we make the DAC output voltage range from 0 to $V_{ref}$. We start with setting the MSB of the register high. The output of the DAC should be $0.5V_{ref}$ and we compare this value to the input value. If the input value is higher than $0.5V_{ref}$, we keep the MSB high. Otherwise (as in the diagram below), we set the MSB low. Next we want to find the second MSB. We repeat the process again - set the 2nd MSB high and see if the input is higher or lower. If the input is higher we keep the 2nd MSB (like in the diagram) and if the input is lower we set the 2nd MSB low. We continue this process until we reach the LSB.
