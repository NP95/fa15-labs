    "In this phase you will experiment on different musical genres, and develop a reasonably accurate PCA classifier. You will acquire data using the Launchpad and microphone circuit, then stream it to the PC. You develop a model in this iPython Notebook (since iPython has pretty graphs and lots of computing power, and a Launchpad does not). You will then experiment with different methods of signal processing to develop a classifier algorithm. You will also examine ways to optimize the classification and evaluate the accuracy of the prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you (and your GSI) are satisfied with the classifier's accuracy, you will port the classifier into the Launchpad code in Energia. <b>You will need to write a report explaing your design choices, methodology, and the classifying algorithm you created.</b> As a reminder, you will have 2 weeks to work on this phase since version A is heavy on PCA.\n",

    "- Experiment with different genres\n",
