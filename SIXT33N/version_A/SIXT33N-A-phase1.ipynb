    "To enable the SIXT33N to recognize certain genres, it will need a microphone ciruit to pick up the music and do some circuit signal processing before the music is sampled by the Launchpad ADC. This processing includes applying some gain and filtering higher frequencies to avoid aliasing. Once the signal is sampled, the Launchpad will perform an FFT so that the music an be analyzed in the frequency domain. Finally the data will be streamed back to a PC to be used in the next phase.\n",
