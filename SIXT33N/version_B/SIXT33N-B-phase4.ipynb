As a reminder, the objective is to get the SIXT33N to move straight when it hears a command, and to move either fast or slow depending on which command it head."

    "###Encoder Pins\n",
    "\n",
    "The top of the sketch contains some constant and variable definitions. We start with defining pins. The choice of these pins (especially the encoder pins) are embedded in the actual code, so if pins 2.4 or 1.4 got burned at some point in the semester, now is the time to flag down your GSI. They will help you modify the important part of the sketch.\n",
    "\n",
    "###Data Collection Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "After defining some more constants, we reach the block labeled \"Enveloping constants.\" <b>Use your phase 2 results to fill in these constants.</b> As a reminder, `SNIPPET_SIZE` is the number of samples in your speech snippet, `PRESNIPPET` is the number of samples in the snippet before it crosses the threshold, and `THRESHOLD` is the threshold value (out of 1) for the starting sample of the snippet relative to the highest sample after enveloping.\n",
    "\n",
    "###PCA Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "In the main body of the sketch, the code defines 2 modes: `MODE_LISTEN` and `MODE_DRIVE`. We can look at the 2 modes and see what they are doing. \n",
    "\n",
    "In `MODE_LISTEN`, the SIXT33N listens for and classifies commands. The Launchpad will repeatedly record some samples and take the envelope. You don't want to classify classroom noise, so the code checks if the the envelope has surpassed a certain loudness level. If that loudness level is passed, then it assumes that you spoke a command at is, and it will try to classify the sound envelope using the PCA vectors. If the Launchpad sucessfully classifies a command then it will enter `MODE_DRIVE`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to the section labelled \"PCA variables/constants\". Again, <b>use your phase 2 results to fill in the arrays.</b> If you did not need to use zero-meaning for your PCA you can leave the `pca_mean` vector as `{0}`. We have already provided code that does the projection in the main loop of the sketch.\n",
    "\n",
    "###Wheel Control\n",
    "\n",
    "In `MODE_DRIVE`, the SIXT33N executes the closed loop control. Depending on the command that was classified, it will set a desired speed and then go straight at that speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, you will need to fill in the variables for the closed loop control. In the section marked \"Controller gain vector\" <b>add your controller gain values for the left and right wheels you found in phase 3.</b> We have also provided the code that takes care of the closed loop control.\n",
    "\n",
    "###PCA Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there is one more section you need to modify: the PCA classification. Inside the function `loop()`, in the section marked `YOUR CODE HERE`, <b>add your classification boundaries in the `if` statements from phase 2.</b> The first `if` statement triggers a fast straight drive while the second triggers a slower straight drive. You can also change the values `0.06` and `0.02` if you want to use a speed."

If you forgot the pins you should attach to the motors and encoders, you can find them in the define statements in the top of the Launchpad sketch. If your car doesn't have as much drive as before, you might need to change to fresh batteries - check the voltage of your battery using the Digital Multimeter and if it is considerably less than 9V ask for fresh ones.\n",
