The choice of these pins (especially the encoder pins) are embedded in the actual code, so if pins 2.4 or 1.4 got burned at some point in the semester, now is the time to flag down your GSI.

If you need other variables in your control loop, declare them here.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two sections you need to modify for the controls. Firstly, inside the function `loop()`, around line 195 in the sections marked `YOUR CODE HERE`, <b>add code to control the movement of the SIXT33N.</b> We have provided most of the functionality of a helper function `wheel_drive` which resets all counters and sets the new desired wheel speeds. Fill in the arguments to the function call to set the desired wheel speeds and add any new variables that you need to implement turns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that the code you implemented can move the car in \"straight\" or \"turning\" direction before you add any more functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, <b>fill in the last `YOUR CODE HERE` block around line 170.</b> This provides the input $u[k]$ to the closed loop system - you should have similar code from phase 3. Use the variables `alpha1_left`, `alpha2_left`, `alpha1_right`, `alpha2_right`, `left_position`, `right_position`, `left_target_speed`, `right_target_speed`, `left_current_speed` and `right_current_speed` in the two function calls to `input_left` and `input_right`.\n",

    "That's it! You should be set for the Launchpad code. Now load the sketch into your Launchpad and make sure your Launchpad's 5V pin is connected to the voltage regulator output. If you forgot the pins you should attach to the motors and encoders, you can find them in the define statements in the top of the Launchpad sketch. If your car doesn't have as much drive as before, you might need to change to fresh batteries - check the voltage of your battery using the Digital Multimeter and if it is considerably less than 9V ask for fresh ones.\n",

Next, copy the `classify` function from phase 2 that returns the string describing the gesture as found in the bottom of the script (\"up\", \"down\", \"left\", \"right\", \"circle\"). Lastly, run the script from the command line and draw gestures on the canvas. The script will transmit a 500Hz audio signal to be picked up by the SIXT33N. It might help to put the speakers on the ground so it is closer to the SIXT33N.\n",

Bring your <b>`capture_and_transmit.py`</b> script and load it in the checkoff station. Run it in the command line and draw gestures, showing the SIXT33N moving as expected. You should also prepare to bring your controller diagram from phase 3 and explain how your control system implements turns. You might also get some questions from the staff.\n",
