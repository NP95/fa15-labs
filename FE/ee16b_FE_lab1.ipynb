    "Welcome to the third module - Front End! In the first module we learned how the brain wave data we record can be used to predict the behavior of the subject while in the second module we learned how we can convert an analog signal (something from the natural world) to a digital signal (something representable in a computer). Recall the block diagram below from the DSP module:\n",

    "\n",
    "Our goal in this module is to build the <b>Signal Conditioning</b> block in the top row above. Although the voltages we get from the brain are analog signals, they are very <i>very</i> small, usually in the order of ~1$\\mu$V. We need to provide some amplification and filtering such that our signal is within the acceptable range for our ADC input (in our case, the Launchpad). The block diagram of the circuit we will implement in this module is shown below.\n",

    "We will see how each block above is needed by trying to use the Launchpad ADC at every stage. We will also try using both sinusoids and a simulated Local Field Potential (LFP) BMI signal from the first BMI lab.\n",

    "This week we will build a set of amplifiers that we will slowly build up from as we encounter different issues. <b>As you can see above, the circuit we will be building is quite complicated. Please try to be very neat and plan ahead in your breadboard layout.</b>\n",
